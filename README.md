# Udacity DS ND program, Deep learning - Image Classifier Project

Project code.

In this project, 1st step to develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a python application which will run from command line.

This app will 1st train the deep learning model on data set of images, then use the trained model to classify images.
